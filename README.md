# Signal-Processing-using-FFT-and-FIR
This project help us understand how unwanted frequencies can be removed using FFT'

This project covers why FFT , covers differnce between DFT, FFT AND FIR , IIR . 
Here we gEnerated a noisy signal added it with more 4 sinals then added all the signals together plotted it to visualize then passed that through FFT and LPF BPF all the steps were plotted.
